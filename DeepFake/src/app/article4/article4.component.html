                        <p>The name Deepfake" is derived from the underlying AI technique of deep learning. Deep learning algorithms are u
                            sed to swap faces in video and digital information to create realistic-looking false media. Deep learning
                             algorithms train themselves how to solve issues when given vast volumes of data. However, how can we avoid it? 
                             <br><br>

                            
                            There are a few ways to avoid it, the first of which is the legal measures. There are currently no substantial
                             measures in place to protect persons from deepfaking or faked voice recordings. Increasing the costs of creating
                              and disseminating (or assisting) fraudulent material by imposing severe penalties on the behavior will function 
                              as a deterrent to improper uses of technology. The next task is to train your computers to recognize fakes. 
                              Some of the current imperfect deepfakes may now be identified using evident antiquities or heuristic analysis. 
                              Microsoft has unveiled a new method for detecting faults in synthetic media. The Defense Advanced Research 
                              Projects Agency, or DARPA, is working on a software called SemaFor that aims to detect semantic flaws in 
                              deepfakes, such as an image of a guy generated with anatomically incorrect teeth or a person wearing socially 
                              unusual jewelry. Last but not least, the use of blockchain technology might be a solution. A distributed ledger,
                               or blockchain, allows you to store data online without the use of centralized servers. Furthermore, blockchains
                                are resistant to a wide range of security vulnerabilities that centralized data storage are susceptible to.
                                 Although distributed ledgers are not currently capable of storing large amounts of data, they are suitable 
                                 for storing hashes and digital signatures.

                            It's critical to educate people about AI algorithms' amazing powers. This can help users become more aware 
                            of emerging technologies like deepfakes, which can help avoid, at least to some extent, the development of 
                            problematic programs like FakeApp.
